# Hi Runtime
A cross-platform C language object-oriented standard library.

I wanted a very lightweight c language framework that would provide capabilities like memory management and thread management, as well as some object-oriented abstractions and a variety of common base libraries. After repeatedly having to rewrite similar frameworks, I decided to write one that I could use all the time.

The goal is to support esp32, stm32, ios, android, macos, linux, windows various operating systems and non-os, so as to complete some common frameworks and algorithms on this basis.
